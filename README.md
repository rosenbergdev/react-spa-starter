# Single Page App Starter

- Webpack
- Babel
- ESlint
- CSS Modules

## Setup

```npm run setup``` (install & build)

```npm run dev``` (developement, http://localhost:3000)

```npm run build``` (generate production bundle)

## Notes
Iâ€™m using custom eslint rules, feel free to replace them. Stylus is set up as default CSS preprocessor. For presentation purposes Roboto Mono font is included.
